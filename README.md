# Caesars Cipher Decoder App

A React app which decodes a string encoded in the Caesars Cipher ROT13 encoding scheme. 
Created in React using React-Boostratp UI elements, it is a development upon the initial algorithm I wrote as one of the projects for the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Certification.
